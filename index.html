        <p class="aboutMe">
          My name is Brian Jopling. I am currently enrolled at Drexel University as a Computer Science major, with a concentration in Computer Security.
          I have been programming for the last eight years, with my experience comprising of an abundance of languages, including Python, Bash, PHP, JavaScript, C++, Java, C#, and many more.
          I also enjoy working with robotics, and love tinkering with my Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
          <br><br>A desire to build computer games is what originally brought me into the Computer Science field.
           I would often spend my childhood hours hacking together pieces of code that wouldn't resemble a game until you ran the final executable file.
           <br><br>Having played a lot of online games when I was younger, I was always trying to find ways to break them.
            I was often successful by using injections of code in the game's chat system, or by buying an overwhelming number of items from an in-game shop.
            Eventually, I started trying techniques similar to these on websites.
            I would view the source code of a website, look for something that I could abuse or manipulate, and try it. Breaking things became my newest hobby.
            <br><br>In my free time today, I can be found participating in CTFs, attending local Cyber Security meetups, and tackling bug bounties.
            I am a co-founder of <a href="https://www.dc215.org">the official DEF CON group of Philadelphia, DC215.</a> Outside of the security world,
            my time is spent practicing guitar and piano, two instruments I am incredibly passionate about. 
          <br><br>In the future, I intend to continue working in the cyber security field as an Information Security Engineer or a Chief Information Security Officer in order to advance my skills as a computer scientist and pen-tester, and continue doing what I love most.

          <p class="projectDescription">
            <a href="https://github.com/clayball/nector">NECTOR</a> is an open source Security Information & Event Manager (SIEM), sponsored by the <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania School of Arts & Sciences.</a>
            The purpose of NECTOR is to increase security awareness among institutions by demonstrating potential security vulnerabilities.
            NECTOR is a powerful and expandable framework used in the collection, analysis, and sharing of security intelligence information.
            NECTOR takes advantage of the functionality and stability of the Django framework, and incorporates a customizable database backend with a minimalistic frontend.
            The project is being developed without the use of JavaScript.
            NECTOR's intuitive web-based frontend allows for easy data analysis, scan configuration, incident reporting, and more.
            NECTOR was a project my supervisor <a href="http://www.cwells.org/">Clay Wells</a> and I created during my time working at the University of Pennsylvania School of Arts & Sciences.

          <p class="projectDescription"><a href="https://thecaveoftrials.wordpress.com/">The Cave of Trials</a> is a 2D top-down puzzle game consisting of 50+ levels. I made this game during my freshman year of college in a team of five using the Unity Game Engine and C#. I acted as both the Project Manager and Lead Programmer for my team, as I was the only one who had prior experience with C# and making games in general. In the process of creating this game, I also learned how to properly manage online repositories, such as Bitbucket.
          The goal of The Cave of Trials is to successfully move the player to the exit of each level by moving or rearranging
          rocks in order to open pathways through the levels. Each rock has its own unique ability. One rock can only move a certain number of times. One will move two spaces. One won’t move at all. One will move one space at a time. One slides until hitting another rock. And the rest... You'll see! Will you be able to escape The Cave of Trials?

        <p class="projectTitle">&nbsp;<a style="color:black; text-decoration:none">Mark</a></p><br><br>
        <p class="projectDescription">Mark is a 2D graphic adventure game that tells a heartfelt story about a man named Mark whose wife has mysteriously disappeared.
        A friend and I created this game during the Spring Break of our first year at college. I wrote the script and did the storyboarding, and also did the programming in C# using the Unity Game Engine.
        My friend, Andrew Mainhart, did all the art. The two of us live in different states, so our communication was limited to Skype calls and texting.
        Creating this game taught me how to work with someone over the web, rather than in-person.
        In the game itself, you play as Mark as he remembers how significant his wife's role was in his life, and uncover the mystery of what had happened on the night she disappeared.

          You'll tap and tap, gaining riches which can be used to purchase upgrades and power-ups that will help you grab even more coins.
          Wanna be fashionable while grabbing coins? Coin Grabber also features various cosmetics that can be purchased using the coins you grab in-game.
          Once you start grabbing coins, you'll never wanna stop.
          <br>I created this game during the summer of 2015 in order to learn the process of making and publishing an app to the app store. I wrote this app in C# using the Unity Game Engine.

        <p class="projectTitle">&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/PolyatomicBrian/The-Sawyer-Trail">The Sawyer Trail</a></p><br><br>
        <p class="projectDescription"><a href="https://github.com/PolyatomicBrian/The-Sawyer-Trail">The Sawyer Trail</a> was the first game I ever wrote in Java. I made this as part of my 11th grade Computer Science course in high school.
          The game itself is a parody of the popular 70s game, The Oregon Trail. I named the game after my awesome CS teacher, <a href="http://www.mrsawyer.com">Mr. Sawyer</a>.<br>
          In The Sawyer Trail, you take control of a party of 5 that is traveling in a school bus to a hack-a-thon. You must make sure the people in your party do not starve, all while you worry about the bus having enough fuel to finish the journey.<br>
          The game prides itself on its replayability, as no two games will ever be alike due to the factor of randomness. With humorous dialogue, a unique story, and hours of entertainment, it's no wonder all my classmates loved this game.

            <a href="https://github.com/PolyatomicBrian/Reddit-Spelling-Checker-Bot/blob/master/myBot.py">Reddit Spelling Bot</a> is an automated tool used to help ensure that the word "spelling" would always be spelled the right way on <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>.
            If someone makes a comment that contains the word "speeling" or "speling" in it, then the bot will comment to that person with the correct spelling.
            The bot was written in Python, and it was the first automated tool I'd ever created. To make this bot, I used the PRAW library, which is an acronym for "Python Reddit API Wrapper." It was surprisingly simple to write the bot, and it only required 30 lines of code.
            The code can easily be changed to allow the bot to search for any other key word or phrase, and comment with whatever the programmer would like it to say.

          <a href="https://github.com/PolyatomicBrian/Forbidden-File-Brute-Forcer/blob/master/bruteforce.py">File Brute Forcer</a> is a program that will append words from a dictionary to the end of an entered URL in an attempt at brute forcing a website to obtain access to forbidden files from a website.
          If any of the words and their extensions are found in the URL's directory, the program will then write them to a new text file to ensure the user does not lose them.
          The program was written in Python, and was thrown together during the Steam Summer Sale of 2016 to help the community figure out whether or not Valve was hosting an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">ARG</a> during the event.
